Unfortunately, I am unable to directly access and view the content of specific files on GitHub, including the .gitignore file at the provided URL. My capabilities are limited to processing information that is publicly available and directly provided to me.
Therefore, I cannot tell you what is inside that particular .gitignore file.
However, I can tell you what a .gitignore file generally does:
A .gitignore file is a text file in the root directory of your Git repository. It specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore. Files matching the patterns listed in the .gitignore file will not be:
 * Tracked by Git
 * Included in commits
 * Shown in git status as untracked files
Common things you might find in a .gitignore file include:
 * Temporary files: .log, .tmp, etc.
 * Build artifacts: bin/, obj/, target/, etc. (depending on the programming language and build system)
 * Executable files: (unless they are part of the distribution)
 * Operating system specific files: .DS_Store (macOS), Thumbs.db (Windows)
 * IDE specific files and directories: .idea/ (IntelliJ), .vscode/ (VS Code)
 * Dependency installation directories: node_modules/ (Node.js), venv/ or .env/ (Python)
 * Configuration files containing sensitive information: (it's better to have template configuration files and ignore the actual ones with secrets)
If you want to know the specific contents of that file, you will need to:
 * Open the link in your web browser.
 * View the contents of the .gitignore file directly on GitHub.
I hope this general information is helpful!
